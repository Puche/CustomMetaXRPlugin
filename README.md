# CustomMetaXRPlugin
Custom port MetaXR plugin, untested an probably bugged. Is the v57 5.2 plugin ported to 5.3 as it. Do not use in Production. Many things bypassed.
All content of this Plugins is Property of META. I only re-writte needed lines to compile the plugin. But i bypassed a few systems.

Binaries are generated to 5.3.1 version. The content should be in <YourProject>/Plugins/MetaXR/<thisRepoContent>

Also it can be stored in <yourEnginePath>/Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/MetaXR/<thisRepoContent> to use it in any project.

Enjoy!
